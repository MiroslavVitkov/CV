I am a pretty dumb person who however has obtained some skills that might be helpful.  \\

My passion is C++ with all the "does this container size allign with a cache line"-s\footnote{this happens under linux and I would not be willing to test on other OS's. However I strongly insist on standard-compliant code.}.
In terms of DL I know that I know nothing: it's too huge and fast growing field to master beyong 'back propagation', 'activation function', 'recurrent layer'.
Graphics I've done with SDL and Qt if that's relevant.  \\

Reading the in job ad "entire production pipeline" excites me: I am so fed up with separating development into mini-roles like "manual tester"; and so is everyone - thus the rise of DevOps - we are (slowly) getting there.  \\
