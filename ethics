This is a manifesto of my work ethics and preferences.
My CV expresses what I boast about.
Let me tell you the rest of the (subjective) picture.

I oppose the `agile` methodology:

I revere superior colleagues.
If there is no one to teach me anything - no.
If there is no one less knowledgeable than me - fine, I have thrown my ego in a ditch a long time ago.

Give me 2/3 of this list and I will be content.
Give me 100% and I will anticipate going to work.

I have made this text public, because ... I strongly believe in openness.

Some theatrical scenarios:

Unhappy with a colleague:
- speak to them
- If uncooperative speak to their line manager
- if uncooperative speak to their manager
- if uncooperative shut up or supply notice of resignation

Happy with someone:
- speak to their direct manager

My direct line is not happy:
- call a 20 minute meeting that establishes why that is and identifies solutions
- a month later, if nothing has changed, repeat
- a month later, if nothing has changed, get sacked

A colleague asks me to do something for them:
- if I find it useful AND estimate it to less than a day, I do it
- if longer, I ask my manager
- if not useful I tell them 'go ask my manager'

Estimation:
- when asked to provide one, I expect at least a day's worth of time PURELY for that task

My line manager wants to know the progress of a tasks:
- they stand up from their PC, make a coffee and come chat about the weather. and the task eventually.

Things I enjoy:
- code at least 30% of the time; maintenance coding is a (necessary) drag
- 20% downtime for work-related education e.g. lectures in YouTube, watercolor architecture small-talk
- emphasis on code quality; tech debt being cleared at least every 10 years

A blocker emerges:
- ask around who knows( verbally, failing that company chat )
- speak verbally to the person
- if too occupied, ask their manager for scheduling

AFAIK, in management "science", this is called a "military type organization".
I enjoy it because everyone is accountable to one person, with the possibility of escalating when unfair treatment is perceived.
It accommodates Joel's 12 and can be quite the serene place.
